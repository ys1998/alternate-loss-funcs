# Research - Neural Language Modeling
This repository is an extension of the **Language Modeling** codebase by Kalpesh Krishna (@martiansideofthemoon) and was developed as a part of my R&D Project titled **"Alternate Loss Functions for Neural Language Modeling"** under Prof. Preethi Jyothi (@pjyothi) during January 2018 - present.
